# AI-Chat-Bot
In this chatbot, users can ask any question and receive instant responses. This chatbot has an elegant and responsive user interface, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices. Keep in mind that to generate a response to the user query, this chatbot uses the OpenAI API, which is free.
To start, add the following HTML codes to  index.html file: This code snippet includes a chatbot header, a chatbox unordered list (ul), and an input field for user messages. By default, the chatbot will display a greeting message as the first chat “li”. We’ll use JavaScript later to dynamically add more chat “li” that contain chat details.
Next, add the following CSS codes to your style.css file to apply visual styling to your chatbot. Now, if you load the web page in your browser, you will only see the chatbot toggle button at the bottom right corner. You can customize this code to your liking by adjusting the color, font, size, and other CSS properties.
Finally, add the following JavaScript code to your script.js file: This script code will make your chatbot functional, which means now you can ask your questions, show or hide the chatbot by clicking the bottom right toggle button, and more.
” Remember that when you sign up for OpenAI, you’ll get a free $5 credit for your API usage. If your account is older than 3 months or the credit runs out, you’ll need a paid account or create a new one with a new number to keep using the API. Your API usage and expiration date can be found on the account’s usage page.”

The above code provided follows a simple flow. First, it displays the user’s message in the chatbox and uses the OpenAI API to generate an appropriate response to the message. While waiting for the API response, a “Thinking…” message is shown. Once the response is received, it replaces the “Thinking…” message in the chatbox.
